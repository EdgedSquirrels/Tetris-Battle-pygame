## Introduction
[Tetris Battle](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Battle) was a well-known online tetris game on Facebook. But due to its closure in 2019, the game is no longer available in Facebook. As an aficionado of this game, I re-made the [game](https://github.com/EdgedSquirrels/Tetris-Battle) in C++ with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). However, setting up the SFML environment may be hard for beginners. Therefore, I made a pygame version based on [mvc-game-design](https://github.com/wesleywerner/mvc-game-design), and it will make installation easier. Also, the framework is redesigned for better readibility and maintenance.

## Game Mechanism
Most of the implementation follows [Tetris Guideline](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline). And this implementation supports Super Rotation System/Standard Rotation System ([SRS](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS)) as well.

### Scoring
The scoring mechanism is based on [Tetris Battle](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Battle#Garbage) settings.

### Players
It currently supports 1 player or 2 players. It can be set from the menu. For the two players, 2 modes can be chosen from: `KEYBOARD`, `LOG`.

The description of playing modes are shown below:
- `KEYBOARD`:
  In this mode, the player is manipulated with keyboard. The  mappings are shown below:
  **1P**:
  - `Up` and `X` are to rotate 90째 clockwise.
  - `Space` is to hard drop.
  - `Shift` and `C` are to hold.
  - `Ctrl` and `Z` are to rotate 90째 counterclockwise.
  - `Left`, `Right`, and `Down` arrows are to move. 

  **2P**:
  - `0` is to hold.
  - `8`, `4`, `6`, and `2` are hard drop, left shift, right shift, and soft drop respectively.
  - `1`, `5`, and `9` are to rotate 90째 clockwise.
  - `3` and `7` are to rotate 90째 counterclockwise.
- `LOG`:
  In this mode, the player is from the log file `log/log.txt` or `log/log2.txt`. The game will automatically log the movements you make in each game. The name of the log file is in this format: `log [year]-[month]-[date] [hour]-[minute]-[second] [1P|2P].txt`. If you want to play against your log, simply rename the log file to `log/log.txt`(for **1P**)or `log/log2.txt`(for **2P**).
